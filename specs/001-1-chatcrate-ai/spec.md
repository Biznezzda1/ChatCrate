# Feature Specification: ChatCrate - Browser Extension Development Environment Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-1-chatcrate-ai`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "搭建浏览器插件的开发环境，让它可以在浏览器中运行，显示类似于 Hello World 的文本即可"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → ✓ Parsed: Setup minimal browser extension development environment with Hello World functionality
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identified: browser extension, local development environment, basic UI display
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → No major ambiguities - scope is clear and minimal
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✓ User flow defined for installation and verification
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✓ Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → N/A - no data entities for Hello World
7. Run Review Checklist
   → ✓ All requirements clear and testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: FR-003 要求扩展"激活或查看时"显示 "Hello World"。请明确显示方式 → A: Browser Action Popup - 点击工具栏图标弹出小窗口显示
- Q: FR-006 要求"至少支持一个主流浏览器"。请明确主要目标浏览器 → A: Chrome only - 仅支持 Chrome/Chromium
- Q: FR-001 需要 manifest.json。Chrome 扩展现有 Manifest V2 和 V3。请选择目标版本 → B: Manifest V3 - 当前标准
- Q: FR-007 要求"无外部依赖或构建步骤"。对于扩展图标，请明确资源要求 → A: 使用默认图标 - 不提供自定义图标

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer setting up the ChatCrate project, I want to establish a minimal working browser extension development environment, so that I can verify the basic infrastructure is in place and the extension can be loaded and run in a browser before implementing any complex features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have the project source code in my local environment, **When** I load the extension into the browser, **Then** the extension should be successfully installed without errors
2. **Given** the extension is installed in the browser, **When** I click the extension icon in the toolbar, **Then** a popup window should open displaying "Hello World" text
3. **Given** the extension is loaded, **When** I check the browser's extension management page, **Then** the ChatCrate extension should appear as active and enabled

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the Chrome version doesn't support the extension manifest version used?
- What occurs if there are syntax errors in the extension configuration files?
- How does the extension behave if the popup HTML file is missing or corrupted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Project MUST have a valid Manifest V3 browser extension manifest file (manifest.json) with required fields (name, version, manifest_version: 3)
- **FR-002**: Extension MUST be loadable into Chrome browser in developer mode without errors
- **FR-003**: Extension MUST display "Hello World" text in a popup window when the toolbar icon is clicked (action popup in Manifest V3)
- **FR-004**: Extension MUST have a visible icon in the Chrome toolbar (using browser default icon, no custom icon files required)
- **FR-005**: Project MUST include basic project structure (manifest.json with Manifest V3 format and popup HTML file)
- **FR-006**: Extension MUST work in Chrome browser version 88+ (minimum version supporting Manifest V3)
- **FR-007**: Project MUST use standard modern development tooling (package manager, bundler, linter) without requiring runtime external services (APIs, databases, cloud platforms)
- **FR-008**: Extension MUST be verifiable as running through the popup UI display

**Glossary**:
- **Runtime external services**: Third-party APIs, databases, backend servers, or cloud platforms required during extension operation
- **Development tooling**: npm packages, build tools, linters, formatters, and testing frameworks used during development but not at runtime

## Next Steps

This specification is ready for implementation:
1. **Create Project Structure**: Set up necessary files (manifest.json with Manifest V3 format, popup.html)
2. **Implement Hello World**: Create minimal popup UI displaying "Hello World"
3. **Test in Browser**: Load extension in Chrome developer mode and verify it works
4. **Document Setup**: Add brief README with installation instructions
5. **Complete**: Once extension loads and displays popup in Chrome browser, MVP is achieved
